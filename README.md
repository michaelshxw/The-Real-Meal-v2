## Project Description
### Your favourite meal planner - The Real Meal
The Real Meal App allows you to create meal plans based off a variety of factors: calories, allergies, dietary preferences and foods that you simply don't like. Then you can store these recipes so you can use them later! Spend more time with the ones that you love, and less time worrying about what you're going to feed them.
